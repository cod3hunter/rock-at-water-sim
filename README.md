# Water SIM

## Overview
Water SIM is an interactive visual effect of water and rocks using a dynamic grid in an HTML5 canvas. The project visually represents rock falls and their interaction with water, creating a ripple effect. While it mimics some behaviors of a simulation, it is primarily a rule-based visual system rather than a physics-driven simulation.

## Features
- Real-time water-like animation
- Interactive environment where users can add rocks
- Wave propagation based on predefined rules
- Smooth animation using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas

### 3. Access the Application
Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost to start using the simulator.
